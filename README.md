## A BRIEF
The Airline Reservation System is a software application designed to manage the process of booking and managing airline tickets for customers. The purpose of this project is to develop an efficient and user-friendly system that simplifies the booking process for passengers and helps airlines manage their flight bookings.


## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The Airline Reservation System is intended for use by airlines to manage their flight bookings and by customers to book and manage their airline tickets. The scope of the project includes developing a system that can handle multiple flights, booking classes, and passengers. The system will allow users to check flight schedules, book tickets, and manage their bookings. The system will also allow airlines to manage their flight schedules, bookings, and passengers.

## GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The primary goal of the Airline Reservation System is to develop a user-friendly system that simplifies the booking process for passengers and airlines. The objectives of the project are:


*To develop a system that can handle multiple flights, booking classes, and passengers.
*To provide users with access to flight schedules and availability.
*To allow users to book and manage their airline tickets.
*To allow airlines to manage their flight schedules, bookings, and passengers.
*To provide a secure and reliable system for booking and managing airline tickets.

## System Overview
### A BRIEF
This code implements an Airline Reservation System that allows users to book seats on a flight. The system prompts users for their origin, destination, name, age, and seat preference. It then checks for seat availability and books a seat for the user if available.
System Architecture
The system is built using Java programming language and consists of two classes - Passenger and Flight. The Passenger class contains details of the passenger such as name, age, seat number, and luxury class. The Flight class contains details of the flight such as origin, number of seats, and number of booked seats. The main method is implemented in the Project class, which prompts users for their input and makes reservations based on their input.
Dependencies
The system does not have any external dependencies and runs solely on the Java programming language.

## Limitations and Constraints
*The system can only handle one flight at a time.
*The system does not have any payment gateway integration, and hence users cannot make payments for the booked seats.
*The system does not have any cancellation functionality.
*The number of seats is fixed and cannot be increased or decreased dynamically.
*The system only supports two destinations - Delhi and Mumbai.
